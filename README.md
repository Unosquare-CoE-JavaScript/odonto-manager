##  Fundamentals

### General objective:

The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is to show our capabilities to develop a responsive web application, using the knowledge already acquired as well as those obtained in the center of excellence. So that we can apply to an offer with a client.

### Main Goal:

The main goal of the software is to help manage some of the most important areas of a small dental office or a single dentist's work. Help  to keep on track the patient's treatment by registering  every medical record and initial diagnosis, manage the agenda and schedule appointments,  inventory control, and Payment control.

### Specific objectives:

-   Patient basic information registration(Personal data)
-   Set the appointment schedule.
-   Keep in order the data and notes on the progress of the patient during the treatment (Medical Records).
-   Generate a search engine in the patients  section to facilitate the search for a patients file.
-   Organize and keep an inventory control.
-   Registration and calculation of patient account status data.

### Problem definition

It is required to develop a progressive web application that works on different platforms through the Internet. Which allows the consultation, elimination and creation of new patients for a dental appointment management system. additionally, the system must allow the doctor to consult the available inventory and his next appointments.  It is intended that the application uses the most current technologies and the most efficient libraries. in the development world both FrontEnd and BackEnd. So that it serves as a letter of introduction for our career.

---
### Professional justification

With the development of this project we seek to demonstrate our capabilities in the development, design, or implementation of the technologies learned during our careers as Front developers, more specifically in ReactJS. and likewise apply effectively to any of the positions available in the company, or to that position.

# informaci√≥n adicional

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
